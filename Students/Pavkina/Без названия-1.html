        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
        <p>Web browsers receive <span class="tags">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span class="tags">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
        <p><span class="tags">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="tags">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="tags">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="tags">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span class="tags">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="tags">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

        <h2>Markup</h2>
        <p><span class="tags">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references, and entity references. <span class="tags">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <p>Another important component is the <span class="tags">HTML</span> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

        <div class="code-example">
            <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </pre>
        </div>

                What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
